*It seems appropriate, as a first blog, to explain why I'm blogging. To be honest, I'm not sure myself. The impulse came from the trip I'm presently going on.*

I'm about three hours along on a flight from Zurich to San Francisco. The lights are off, even though it must be about 4 pm in Switzerland. I won't be the one to complain about it for sure. I'm constantly spying on / being distracted by the five different movies running on personal screen around me. Weird custom, though it makes sense.

Today is my first day out of Europe and on a long-distance flight. Not that I'm proud of it, knowing how bad such flights are for the environmentâ€¦ That will probable come up in a future rant I won't have been able to resist getting out of my head and on paper.

It's one of these days where the whole day is something you've never done before. A whole new day, that puts an unusual perspective on things. Having to sit a full twelve hours in a plane, with no internet connection and limited battery life forces my brain to adapt and find a different output for its permanent raging storm of thoughts. As always, I first tried to numb it in easy, brainless movies, but after the second one I grew tired of it.

So, back to the reason behind this blog, before my thoughts wander too far off. In this last year of studies on media engineering, it was offered to all third-year students to participate in an evening course on "International Innovation Management". Only six engineer and six business students would be accepted. Not many students usually apply to extra-curricular courses, but it strangely makes these much more appealing when you add a trip to California to the equation.

Our job during this course, in groups of four, is to help three Swiss companies expand to the U.S. market. We've had to scout for potential partners, clients and value added resellers, and investigate potential competitors and whatever other restrictions or difficulties that would comme with the territory. The trip itself will therefore be spent networking for the first week, at the end of which we will present our results and get our grade. During the second week, we will play the tourists in Silicon Valley, visiting the typical big companies such as Google, Facebook and so on. Last year, it was asked of the students to make a video, summarizing the trip. I don't know yet whether we'll get a similar assignment, but we do have to blog. "One article in groups of two" is our minimal (and quite insignificant) requirement.

So I took the challenge and took it to a few higher levels. It never came to my mind to blog before, but I realized it would actually be good for me. It would help me channel my thoughts, give an output to my anger, my ideas, my reflexions. All the time I would spend writing wouldn't be spent watching videos and movies. So I took the decision to start blogging on a (hopefully) regular basis, starting with this trip. I will try to write regularly in the next few days, and I'll probably end up choosing one of the most "acceptable" (you can say "politically correct") articles for the course.

I'm looking forward to discovering this land I know so well through fiction, and so little in reality. I have quite a lot of expectations and prejudice about it. About the people, their way of life, their political opinions, about the cities and landscapes, about the efficiency of their government.

I'm looking forward to being right on certain things, and to being wrong on others. I'm looking forward to having new things to look forward to. But above everything else, I'm looking forward to engraving in my memory a lasting picture of the endless American landscapes.
