*It's my fourth day in San Francisco and I finally have some time to write.*

Being with people all the time is exhausting. I don't understand how my classmates are so keen on being together all the time. Even when each team works in a different area of the city, they still try to eat all together at noon, even when it takes two hours to reunite, find a place to eat and, finally, get to the eating part. Whenever the teachers offer an activity, it must absolutely be everyone or no one who accepts it. It feels like the world would fall apart for them if they each went their own way.

I wonder what part of my brain was missing at birth, for that kind of thinking to reach me that little. I've never been one to follow the pack by default. If I like what they're offering to do, I go, but if not, I don't see why I should. The girls say they don't mind, but I know very well they still see me as an outsider. Can't blame them really, I guess that's how it works.

As a perfect example of that situation, I spent my Sunday with only the teacher, let's call him Paul, and his assistant, let's call her Nora. They offered us a tour of San Francisco, and everyone decided to go on their own tour, all together. Except for me of course.

We started with a 45 minutes wait to take the cable car from Powell Street to Lombard Street. I really like the way they call their stops here. You don't need to know the name of the stop, just the two streets that cross there. So simple! From Lombard Street, we went down the hill to Fisherman's Wharf, visiting a few shops on the way. We saw the Musée Mécanique (it's ironic to traverse the globe to see French everywhere, more on that in the promised rant), which contains old mechanical coin-activated games, from 30s' music boxes to the early 2000s pinballs. A bit creepy for some, but it was kind of amazing to see all these games in one place. From there we went to Ghirardelli Plaza, where a classy "School of Cheese" takes place. I felt like I had stumbled upon a French "School of Modesty" or a Serbian "School of Fine Chocolate". The American are not particulary known for their good taste in cheese. They are, however, very good at making overly sweet and caloric drinks, which we discovered at Ghirardelli's chocolate and ice cream bar.

I have a fear, actually, as I'm writing these words, four days after my arrival. I feel that I haven't seen America yet, or its people. I thought it would come after a while, but I fear the most American thing around me is the country music I'm listening to from my phone. San Francisco is a very multicultural city. Actually, I think it's much more Chinese, Mexican, African, Arabic than American. I wasn't hoping for much more when I came here, but I still thought it would feel… different. I thought I would feel I was in America. And actually, it doesn't feel very different from home. It's bigger. It's richer. It's poorer. It doesn't work quite the same way. But it's the same people, the same extinct look in their eyes, the same routine. City people. Same people in all cities, really. It's a bit depressing to think that I travelled to the other side of the known world to find the exact same thing.
