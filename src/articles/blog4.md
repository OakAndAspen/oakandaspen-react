*Since I started blogging on what turns out to be my business website, I thought it interesting to talk about the projects I'm working on. I'll start logically, with a project I started a long time ago.*

At the start of 2015, I was an intern for a governmental institution in Valais. When I started, they put me in charge of updating the public website. It's really an understatement to say they were not up to date technology-wise. They were still using Java Server Pages (JSP) to build the website... Naturally, I was thrilled when they asked me to rebuild the website using a modern CMS called Liferay. Whatever it was, I would be better than the current solution. Of course, no one in the team knew how to use that CMS, so they asked me to take my time to discover it. For weeks I tried to understand how that thing worked, reading the documentation through and through, but I still couldn't figure it out. In the end, they called a specialist who gave me and a few coworkers a two-days course. After those two days, I was only more confused than before. Unfortunately, I had no choice but to go with it. since my project had to start, and that grade would be decisive to pass the year.

So I started the project with very little hope of success. But the difference was, I had a goal. I had a mockup, a clear idea of what I had to achieve. I wasn't just "trying to see how it worked". And that helped immensely. I still had some technical difficulties, but I quickly started putting the pieces of the puzzle together, because I knew what the puzzle should look like in the end. And it turns out that that CMS, that I had been hating for the last weeks, actually turned out to be pretty good and powerful. Liferay is not meant to build a simple website, like Wordpress, but a whole portal. It deals with users and roles across all of the portal's websites, and you can create your page and drop components into it without touching a single line of code. You want a forum ? Just drop the forum component into a page, and then you can customize it in the settings. It was pretty awesome. What I didn't realize at the time is that it had a major flaw: it was written in Java. And everyone knows that Java for the web is not a good idea.

At the time, I was in a celtic reenactment association called Viviskes. Our goal was to recreate the lifestyle of the Celts that lived in what's currently Switzerland about 150 B.C. We would do some research and recreate their clothes, their food, their combat style and so on. We had a public website made with some cheap online CMS like Wix, and a forum with a similarly cheap solution called forumactif.fr. In March 2015, the association's annual general meeting took place. I was just in that phase where I finally understood Liferay and so I offered to create a real website and intranet for Viviskes using that CMS. They approved the idea and I got to work. Unfortunately, it didn't go very far. I quickly realized a regular Apache server wouldn't cut it to run a Java application (dummy!), and so I tried to find Java hosting. I found something but it was much more expensive than what I had in mind, and when I tried it, I simply could not manage to install a functional Liferay instance on it. After a few weeks or months of trying, I gave up on Liferay. However, I had promised Viviskes a new website, and I was going to deliver.

The first version of the website used Silex, a simple PHP backend framework created by Symfony. I didn't use any frontend framework, not even Bootstrap, that I had tried and failed to understand. I didn't have much patience with new tools at the time, and prefered to do everything by hand. That first version had a public website with some dynamic content (articles, partners, future events...), but it could not yet be managed by the users. It also had an intranet featuring a basic forum, an editable user profile and a calendar where the users could create events and sign up for them. Later, I started using Bootstrap at last, and realized what a fool I had been to work without it. I automatically proceeded to a complete makeover of the app's frontend, using Bootstrap.

After a few years, Silex was abandoned by Symfony as a deprecated tool. Symfony Flex took its place as a lightweight and modular framework. That's how technology works, my dears, the world changes fast and you must stay up to date. By then I was in engineering school and had learned lots of new tools, including React, my all time favorite frontend framework. I decided to make a third and brand new version of the Viviskes website and intranet, this time separating the frontend from the backend through an API. I used Symfony Flex to make the API, and Doctrine as an abstraction layer to communicate with the MySQL database. The frontend is a standalone application created with create-react-app. It uses React Router for the routing, Bootstrap for the design, FontAwesome Pro for the icons, and lots of other useful tools and libraries. That Symfony-API/React-App combination became my bread and butter, and I rarely use anything else.

That new version also had a few new features. For one, the users could finally manage the dynamic content that appears on the public website. I also implemented a page were they could manage the association's physical library, entering books and indicating who was borrowing them. I also created the possibility of having forum topics linked to a calendar event instead of just a category. That way, all the information about an event would be in the same place. I also tried to implement a very basic Dropbox, but that feature was not completed in time and will therefore wait for the next update to be released.

I've been working on this project for five years now. The last version alone probably took me the equivalent of 5-6 full-time weeks. It hasn't earned me a penny, but it has taught me a lot. I guess I could try and list a few of the lessons I've learned.

1. Stay up to date with technology. It evolves very fast.
2. If everyone is using a specific technology, it's probably good. Check it out and don't give up at the first sign of trouble.
3. It's much easier to discover a tool or just start a new project if you have a goal and a clear picture in mind. Make a mockup, even if it's very basic.
4. Don't use Java for web development! It's too heavy, and you don't need that drama.

I've integrated that fourth lesson very well. But the other ones I'm still struggling with. It's very tempting to stay in your routine, keep using the same tools you've mastered, and avoid discovering new ones. And you're always thinking "Bah, why would I make a mockup, it's a waste of time.". But in the end, you always wish you had, because it would have saved you a lot of work.
